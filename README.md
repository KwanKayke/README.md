## 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Kwan Kayke

### Web Developer • Physics Student • AI Applicator

---

🚀 I currently work at **[Kontrole Maquetes](https://www.kontrolemaquetes.com.br)**, developing web solutions for internal process automation and management — from network-based checklist systems to image-upload-enabled registration platforms.

🎓 I'm a Physics student with a strong passion for logic and precision. When reality doesn't cooperate, `console.log` usually does.

🧠 Naturally curious and efficiency-driven, I focus on building **real** and **functional** solutions — no "Hello World" fluff here.
